## Overview üõ†Ô∏è
The Angular Frontend project is designed to provide a responsive and dynamic user interface for interacting with the backend services. It demonstrates how to build scalable components and manage application state effectively.

### Project Structure
The project is organized into several key components:
- **Components**: Reusable UI elements that manage their own views and logic.
- **Services**: Handle HTTP requests and business logic, acting as intermediaries between components and backend APIs.
- **Models**: Define data structures used throughout the application.
- **Routing**: Manage navigation and routing for a seamless user experience.

## Technologies Used ‚öôÔ∏è
- **Angular v18**: A platform for building mobile and desktop web applications.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types, making the code more robust and easier to maintain.
- **RxJS**: A library for reactive programming using Observables, enabling asynchronous data handling.
- **DaisyUI**: A component library that provides pre-styled UI elements to speed up development.

## Features ‚ú®
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration interfaces that communicate with the backend for authentication.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive and works seamlessly on mobile and desktop devices.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Uses Angular's routing module to navigate between different views without reloading the page.
- **Loading Indicators**: Implements a loading service to provide feedback during data fetching operations, enhancing user experience.
- **Error Handling**: Displays user-friendly error messages for failed operations or API errors.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:
